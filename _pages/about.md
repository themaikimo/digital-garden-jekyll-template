# About 

Slowly dusting off my ancient **==maikimo.net==** domain, which I registered on ==December 3, 2002==. My blogâ€™s title for several years was _==Tread lightly on the things of earth==_.

At the time, spouse and friends were jokingly calling me **Mikey-Mo**. So I made up the soundalike nonsense word _maikimo_ from it. 

**Wayback Machine curiosities:**
- My [first post](http://web.archive.org/web/20021208143445/http://maikimo.net/radio/) (Dec 7, 2002) at domain _maikimo.net_. I was transitioning my earlier [Radio Userland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_UserLand) blog content to new hosting. 
	- **Fun fact**: [Dave Winer](https://www.encyclopedia.com/economics/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/winer-david), creator of ThinkTankâ€”the Apple II application that turned me on to outliners (~1983)â€”and later, weblog/outliner software Radio Userland, coined the term "weblog," which soon got shortened to "blog."
- Here's my [About me](http://web.archive.org/web/20030503235522/http://maikimo.net/radio/misc/aboutMe.html) from 2002.
- My [last recorded post](http://web.archive.org/web/20140108015806/http://maikimo.net/) (Jan 25, 2013) at domain _maikimo.net_ shows in the final Wayback snapshot (Jan 8, 2014) before the webhost provider I was using unceremoniously vanished.

Wouldn't it be cool to get content happening again at this domain during its 20th year? ðŸ˜®
